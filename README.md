# StudentProject_QT

This is a simple student database management system developed in C++ using QT framework. It utilizes file handling and shows effective implementation of class and object of the programming language. This project will teach you how to add, list, modify and delete records in file in C++ language using a simple QT UI. It is very simple to understand, and the source code too is not that long.

Developed as GUI application, this student database system project uses file to store the studentsâ€™ information mentioned in the features below. You need to compile the source code with QT Creator using the GCC compiler under ubuntu 18.04. The source code and application file can be directly colned or downloaded from this repository.

This project is setup as a git repo such that each step along the way that requires file changes is done for you ahead of time as a git commit.  It's best to follow through the directions on your own, but if you get stuck, you can see how how to do it by looking at these git commits.

To see how to do step 4, just do:


## 1: project directory

Make a new folder for your app (can be named qt-example or whatever you want).

`mkdir student-example`

Now that you've made your folder, move into it.

`cd student-example`


## 2: download git repo

You can clone directly the repo under the previous created directory ysing a git client such as github or using git command.

`git clone ...`


## 4: compile and run program

under QT directory, set this project as the active project, then run this squence(in the QT):
`clean`
`Run qmake`
`build`

The app should be functional now, so `Run` and enjoy your application !!!


## 5: Needed packages
for database : sqlite
IDE : QT creator and preinstalled qmake
Platform :ubuntu 18.04
